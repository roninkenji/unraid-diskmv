unraid-diskmv
=============

A set of utilities to move unRAID user share directories between disks 

These utilities move files around on an unRAID server. I have done my best to 
prevent any data loss, but there is always a chance something can go wrong. Use at your own risk and please ensure you have everything backed up.
